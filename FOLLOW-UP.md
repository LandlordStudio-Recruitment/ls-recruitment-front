# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

Integration tests and unit tests for both frontend and backend.
Better separation of layers in the backend.
Smaller components in the frontend.
More comments throughout the codebase.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

Unfortunately, it was a rushed work due to time constraint, so nothing I'm too proud of :(.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

Setting up the frontend project was time consuming (redux, theme, routing, etc)

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

It was good overall. I think it'd be great to know how much time I'd be expected to spend before I start.
